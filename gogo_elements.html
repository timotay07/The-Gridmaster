			<h1>The Go Go Framework</h1>
			<h2>Design to Development</h2>
			<p>The Go Go Framework was developed as a tool to help Designers and Developers to collaborate and just get stuff done. Many do not believe that one can get a mockup correct pixel for pixel. The Go Go Framework is built and programmed to ignore this rhetoric. Designers: Download the Go-Go Framework and use the Adobe Illustrator Go-Go Grid template found in the DesignersAssets directory. Developers: Download the Go-Go Framework and open the index page to start developing designs, and when you are done, delete the gogo.js file. And...presto! The grid is gone!</p>
